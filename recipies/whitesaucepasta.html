        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Chilli Flakes</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 150 grams of pasta according to instructions on the package. I used regular penne pasta which was supposed to be boiled for 9 to 11 minutes. and drain. Make sure you don’t overcook your pasta, you want it al-dente. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies –

            1 small red onion, chopped
            1 medium red pepper, sliced
            3/4 cup small broccoli florets
            1/2 cup sweet corn (frozen corn which I added to hot water for 5 minutes before using).</li>
        <li>Cook the veggies for 2 minutes. They should remain crunchy. You can use other veggies like carrots, peas as well.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove veggies onto a plate.</li>
        <li>To another pan or you can use the same pan, now add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter.</li>
        <li>Once the butter melts, add the 5-6 chopped garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Then add in 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of flour.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. You don’t have to brown the flour much.</li>
        <li>Then add in 2 cups of milk. You can also add 1/4 cup heavy cream here or use additional 1/4 cup milk.</li>
        <li>Mix everything using a whisk so that there are no lumps formed.

        </li>
        <li>Add in the seasonings:

            1 teaspoon Italian seasonings
            1 teaspoon dried oregano
            1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (to taste)
            1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
            black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Mix in everything and let the sauce simmer.</li>
        <li>Sauce will thicken as it simmers and in 4 to 5 minutes it will coat the back of the spoon. Turn heat to lowest.</li>
        <li>Add in the veggies and the boiled pasta.</li>
        <li>Toss until the pasta and veggies are coated with the sauce. Taste test and adjust the seasonings at this point. Serve warm!</li>
    </ol>
