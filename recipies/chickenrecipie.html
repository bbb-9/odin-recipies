        <li>Toss together squash, leek, oil, and lemon juice in a 12-inch cast-iron or oven-safe skillet. Spread in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Stir butter, cilantro, ginger, coriander, lemon zest, and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until combined. Set aside 1 tablespoon butter mixture. Carefully loosen skin from chicken breast and thighs. Spread remaining 3 tablespoons butter mixture evenly under skin.
        </li>
        <li>Tie legs together with twine and lift wing tips up and over back; tuck under chicken. Place chicken, breast side up, on top of squash mixture in skillet. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Roast, uncovered, stirring squash mixture halfway through, until a thermometer inserted in thickest part of chicken breast reads 160°F, 45 to 55 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Toss together squash mixture, skillet drippings, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and reserved 1 tablespoon butter mixture in skillet. Carve chicken and serve with roasted vegetables. Garnish with cilantro leaves.</li>
